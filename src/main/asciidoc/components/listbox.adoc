Definition: a *listBox* allows the user to select one or more items from a list contained within a static, multiple line
text box. The user clicks inside the box on an item to select it, sometimes in combination with the â‡§ Shift or Ctrl
in order to make multiple selections. "Control-clicking" an item that has already been selected, unselects it.
