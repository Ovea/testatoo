Testatoo is built on top of http://code.google.com/p/selenium/[Selenium], it can work with any browser supported by https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/FrequentlyAskedQuestions[Selenium] (IE, Google-chrome, Firefox, ...).
Even though Testatoo provides, like http://www.gebish.org/testing[geb], an extra layer of convenience and productivity, it's always possible to "fallback" to the WebDriver level to do something directly, should you need to.
But Testatoo adds a powerful DSL, while maintaining the usage of Groovy and keeps the advantages of a strongly typed language.
